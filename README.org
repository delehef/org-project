~org-project~ provides functions for the creation of [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] TODOs that are associated with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Projects.html][Emacs projects]].

This package is originally forked from and now heavily based on [[https://github.com/IvanMalison/org-projectile][org-projectile]].

* Installation
Installation from MELPA is not available yet.
* Setup
Before using org-project, you must specify the file you would like to use for storing project =TODOs=, as well as a keybinding for taking a project note with org-capture and a global keybinding for ~org-projectile-project-todo-completing-read~. It is recommended that you start with the following configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package org-project
      :bind (:map project-prefix-map
                  ("t" . org-project-quick-capture)
                  ("o" . org-project-capture)
                  ("T" . org-project-open-todos)))
#+END_SRC
** Per-repo TODO files
If you would prefer to have an org file for each project that resides in the project directory, add the following elisp to your configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-project
    :bind (:map project-prefix-map
                ("t" . org-project-quick-capture)
                ("T" . org-project-capture))
    :custom
    (org-project-todos-per-project t))
#+END_SRC
* Usage
** ~org-project-capture~
Triggers ~org-capture~ using the template provided in ~org-project-capture-template~.

** ~org-project-quick-capture~
Prompts for a simple TODO, that is then captured using ~org-project-quick-capture-template~.

** ~org-project-open-todos~
Jump to the org-mode heading containing the TODOs for the current project.

All of these functions will create the relevant top level heading in the [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] file stored in ~org-project-projects-file~ if ~org-project-per-project-file~ is ~nil~, or in ~org-project-todos-per-project~ under the project root if it is ~t~.
